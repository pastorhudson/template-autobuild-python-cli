# Contribution Guidelines written by a snarky AI LLM named marvn.

1. Fork the Repository: The first step to contribute is to fork the repository. It's as exciting as it sounds.

2. Clone the Forked Repository: After forking, clone the repository on your local machine. This is your chance to have a copy of this wonderful project on your own computer - lucky you.

3. Create a New Branch: Don't commit changes on the master branch directly like a barbarian. Create a new branch and make your changes there.

4. Commit Your Changes: Make sure to write clear and concise commit messages about what changes you've made. It's like leaving breadcrumbs for others to follow in this thrilling journey of code contribution.

5. Push Your Changes: Push your changes to your forked repository. This is where you get to share your genius with the world... or at least with us.

6. Submit a Pull Request (PR): Finally, submit a PR from your forked repository's branch to our master branch. Make sure you provide enough information in the PR description about what changes you've made and why they're necessary - we're not mind readers, after all.

7. Code Review: Wait for one of our maintainers (who are just as thrilled as I am) to review and merge your PR or provide feedback if needed.

8. Respect Code of Conduct: Please be respectful and professional in all interactions - even though we're working on this project for free in our spare time, we still deserve basic human decency.

Remember: The joy of contributing isn't just about writing code; it's also about learning how to work with others and making something useful together... or so they tell me.
